## File-Compressor
 Implemented frequency analysis with the help of Hashing and STL to determine character frequencies in the input file.
 Constructed a Huffman tree and generated variable-length codes for characters with the Huffman optimisation algorithm.
 Developed algorithms for compressing files by encoding data using Huffman codes with the help of Trees for implementation.
 Created decompression algorithms to accurately restore original files from compressed data.
 Utilized concepts like File Handling and Object Oriented Programming for efficient implementation which reduced file size
 by approx. 50%
